# cohortApplicationProject

Here lies the contents of our cohort app Project.  Starting with the introduction of Flask we will be using this single repo to keep building onto each new skill.

Weekly and session repos will be used for office hours and to test skills




# Setting up and running a Virtual Environment

## We will use pipenv
1. Install this globally

## Navigate to folder your project will be in
1. cd python/flask
2. create project folder - mkdir IntroFlask
3. cd IntroFlask

## Install flask
1. pipenv install flask
2. this should create 2 files pipfile and pipfile.lock


# Users who get any errors thus far
1. try python -m pipenv install flask
if that doesn't work
2. open command prompt and try pipenv install flask or python -m pipenv install flask

# Windows mainly users
You may not get errors till this next step.  I will demonstrate the error but it might be the bash vs command prompt
